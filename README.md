Simple Client Framework Clients to connect to WordPress OAuth Server.

The repo is very new but as time goes on you will see things becoming more tidy.
Although you can use these client frameworks as a universal tool, they are meant to be used for connecting to WordPress OAuth Server

Bare with me and I will put up multiple framework clients. You are more than welcome to contribute your clients if you feel it would be a good fit.
